# DatavisNasaAsteorids

Description:
As part of my Master's program in Human-Computer Interaction (HCC), I undertook a challenging and innovative project that involved converting complex datasets from NASA. My role was to develop a Python script capable of transforming CSV files into Keyhole Markup Language (KML) files. This technical feat allowed for a dynamic and interactive representation of space-related data in Google Earth Pro.

By loading these KML files into Google Earth Pro, users can explore and interact with the data in a visually engaging and intuitive manner. This project not only demonstrates my technical proficiency in data manipulation and software development but also highlights my commitment to enhancing data accessibility and user experience in the field of space research.

The outcome of this project offers a comprehensive and interactive journey through space, enabling users to visually navigate and understand complex astronomical data. This represents the culmination of our exploration and storytelling through space as envisioned in my graduate program. See on the following link:  https://observablehq.com/d/f61a1259d2e23bf9
